            <p>Dear {{ user }},</p>
            <p>We are very sorry to let you know that we are unable to accept your GetQualified assessment test result.</p>

            <p>
                Your assessment test was rejected due to one of (but not limited to) the following reasons: profile picture could not be matched with the face of the test taker, test was not taken under strict exam conditions as requested (e.g. presence of background speach, multiple faces detected by our facial recognition software) or inability to digitally invigilate the test (e.g camera on phone or laptop device covered up or, camera/ microphone not functioning correctly).
            </p>

            <p>We work tirelessly and do our best to ensure that decisions on all assessment results are based on invigilation evidence captured. We want to assure you that your test result received thorough and serious review process.</p>>

            <p>However, we understand that one or more of the default may have occur as a result of circumstances beyond your control. If you believe there may be a misrepresentation due to technical issues please send an email to <a href="mailto:support@getqualified.work">support@getqualified.work</a>.</p>>
        
            <p>Unfortunately, we will not be able to retain your previous scores. We will allow you one final chance to retake the test. You MUST write the test in a well lit room (not facing your camera towards direct light source) and under strict exam conditions. Read and follow ALL instructions in the assessment.</p>
